  <name>Task 1: Take Ember variant desktop screenshot</name>
  <action>
The user needs to take a screenshot of their fully themed desktop in the Ember variant. Claude cannot take desktop screenshots -- this requires the user to visually stage their desktop.

Provide these staging instructions to the user:
  </action>
  <instructions>
**Screenshot staging checklist:**

1. **Switch to Ember variant:**
   ```
   clawmarchy-variant ember
   ```

2. **Reload Waybar:**
   ```
   killall waybar && waybar &
   ```

3. **Open btop in a terminal** -- position it to show system stats clearly

4. **Open Neovim or VS Code** in a second window -- show some code with syntax highlighting

5. **Arrange windows** so Waybar is fully visible at top, btop and editor are both visible

6. **Trigger Walker launcher** (Super+Space) -- keep it open for the screenshot

7. **Take the screenshot while Walker is visible:**
   ```
   grim ~/preview-ember.png
   ```

8. **Copy to repo root:**
   ```
   cp ~/preview-ember.png /home/asem/repos/omarchy-clawmarchy-theme/preview.png
   ```

9. **(Optional) Compress if file is too large:**
   ```
   optipng /home/asem/repos/omarchy-clawmarchy-theme/preview.png
   ```

**What should be visible in the screenshot:**
- Waybar status bar at top (shows accent-colored highlights)
- btop in a terminal (shows themed gradients)
- Neovim or VS Code (shows AMOLED black editor background)
- Walker launcher overlay (shows accent-colored search border)
- Ember variant wallpaper (lantern festival) as desktop background
- All surfaces showing consistent Ember orange accent color
  </instructions>
  <resume-signal>Type "done" after placing the screenshot at preview.png, or describe any issues</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify preview.png and README rendering</name>
  <files>preview.png</files>
  <action>
After the user provides the screenshot:

1. Verify preview.png exists at repo root: `ls -la /home/asem/repos/omarchy-clawmarchy-theme/preview.png`
2. Check file size is reasonable (under 5MB for a single screenshot, ideally around 1-2MB)
3. Verify the README.md image embed line `![Clawmarchy Desktop](preview.png)` is present (it already exists in the current README)
4. If file size is over 3MB and optipng is available, suggest compression

No file modifications needed -- the README already embeds preview.png. This task is verification only.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. `ls -la preview.png` shows file exists and has recent modification time
2. File size is reasonable (under 5MB)
3. `grep "preview.png" README.md` shows the image embed line exists
  </verify>
  <done>preview.png exists in repo root with reasonable file size, and README.md correctly references it via image embed</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- [ ] preview.png exists at repo root with recent timestamp
- [ ] File size is reasonable (under 5MB)
- [ ] README.md contains `![Clawmarchy Desktop](preview.png)` image embed
- [ ] Screenshot shows Ember variant (orange accent color)
- [ ] Screenshot shows multiple themed surfaces (Waybar, btop, editor, Walker)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
preview.png replaced with an Ember variant full desktop screenshot showing all themed components. README image embed renders the new screenshot on GitHub.
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-documentation-and-preview/05-02-SUMMARY.md`
