<objective>
Close two verification gaps from 04-VERIFICATION.md: align REQUIREMENTS.md and ROADMAP.md wallpaper count with the user's accepted deviation (5 not 10), and add an Accent Variants section to README.md so variant switching is discoverable.

Purpose: Both gaps are documentation-only fixes. Gap 1 corrects an inaccurate requirement definition. Gap 2 fulfills VAR-05's "documented with clear instructions" requirement by making variant switching visible in the README.
Output: Updated REQUIREMENTS.md, ROADMAP.md, and README.md

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Align REQUIREMENTS.md and ROADMAP.md wallpaper count with accepted deviation</name>
  <files>.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md, .planning/ROADMAP.md</files>
  <action>
Update REQUIREMENTS.md:
- Change ASST-01 definition from "Wallpaper collection expanded to at least 10 curated anime wallpapers" to "Wallpaper collection contains 5 variant-paired anime wallpapers"
- The [x] checkbox stays — the requirement IS satisfied against the corrected definition
- Update "Last updated" date at the bottom to 2026-02-19

Update ROADMAP.md:
- Change Phase 4 Success Criterion 3 from "Wallpaper collection contains at least 10 curated anime wallpapers that are dark atmospheric scenes working aesthetically with any accent color (not tied to purple)" to "Wallpaper collection contains 5 variant-paired anime wallpapers that are dark atmospheric scenes working aesthetically with any accent color (not tied to purple)"

Do NOT change any other content in either file.

  <name>Task 2: Add Accent Variants section and update Features in README.md</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Update README.md with three changes:

1. **Add Accent Variants section** after the Features section and before the Palette section. Content:

```markdown
## Accent Variants

Clawmarchy ships with 6 accent color variants. Switch with a single command:

```
clawmarchy-variant <name>
```

| Variant | Color | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| yoru | `#7B6CBD` | Muted blue-violet (default) |
| sakura | `#D4839B` | Cherry blossom pink |
| ocean | `#5B8EC9` | Deep sea blue |
| tide | `#5AB5B5` | Coastal teal |
| ember | `#D4895A` | Lantern warm orange |
| moss | `#6EA88E` | Forest green |

Run `clawmarchy-variant --list` to see all options.
```

2. **Update Features list**:
- Change "**Neon purple accents** -- `#7B6CBD` borders, highlights, and UI elements" to "**6 accent variants** -- purple (default), sakura, ocean, tide, ember, and moss"
- Change "**5 curated anime wallpapers** -- dark atmospheric scenes with purple/cyan tones" to "**5 anime wallpapers** -- dark atmospheric scenes paired to each accent variant"

3. **Update Credits section**:
- Change "Wallpapers: [Wallhaven](https://wallhaven.cc)" to "Wallpapers: AI-generated via Google Gemini" since the originals were replaced with Gemini-generated images

4. **Update theme description** (line 7):
- Change "AMOLED dark theme with neon purple accents and curated anime wallpapers" to "AMOLED dark theme with 6 accent color variants and curated anime wallpapers"

<success_criteria>
Both verification gaps from 04-VERIFICATION.md are closed:
- Gap 1: ASST-01 and ROADMAP SC3 match the accepted 5-wallpaper reality
- Gap 2: README.md makes variant switching discoverable to users reading the README
</success_criteria>
